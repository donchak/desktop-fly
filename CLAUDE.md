# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

A 3D fruit fly on a transparent macOS overlay, behavior-driven by a 1 kHz
leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) simulation of a 668-neuron circuit extracted
from the real FlyWire connectome (FAFB v783). The body is procedural
SceneKit; the brain data is real.

## Build, run, verify

```sh
./build.sh                     # bare swiftc, -swift-version 5, no Xcode project
./DesktopFly                   # menu-bar 🪰; quit from there
./DesktopFly --simtest         # circuit invariants (MUST pass after sim/etl changes)
./DesktopFly --behaviortest    # 17 end-to-end sim→body checks (MUST pass after behavior changes)
./DesktopFly --snapshot f.png  # offscreen fly render
./DesktopFly --brainshot b.png # offscreen brain render
```

Always run **both** suites after any change; they are the ground truth.
Both binaries locate `data/` next to the executable or in the cwd
(`findDataDir`) — run them from the repo root or they exit "no data/".
`DESKTOPFLY_FPS=1 ./DesktopFly` logs frame rate to stderr every 5 s.

`--simtest` exits non-zero only on these five (`main.swift:223`): zero GF
spikes over 4 s of rest · ≥1 GF spike during an abrupt loom · walk-drive
crosses its threshold at least once in 20 s · GF-cluster click stimulation
produces a spike · siesta (activityScale 0.84) walk-drive duty > 3%.
Everything else it prints — loom→GF latency (~4 ms), LC/DNa/pop rates,
left-eye steering diff, air-puff GF count — is a **diagnostic, not an
assertion**: read the numbers, don't rely on the exit code to catch a drift
in them. `--behaviortest` is 17 hard checks (7 stimulate-the-sim scenarios +
10 hand-built-signal body checks, incl. no per-frame scale/z snap at landing).

**Platform**: two targets share `data/`. The root Swift build is macOS-only
(Cocoa/SceneKit, bare `swiftc`, macOS 13+) and cannot be built or tested on
Windows — say so plainly rather than implying its suites passed. The `windows/`
subtree is the Electron/TypeScript port and IS verifiable here:
`cd windows && node --test && npm run simtest:strict && npm run behaviortest`.
`etl.py` and the
`data/*.json` invariants are checkable on either platform.

**Windows port gotchas** (each cost real debugging time):
- `THREE.Color(r, g, b)` reads its arguments as **linear**-sRGB; the Swift
  `NSColor(calibratedRed:)` values are sRGB. Convert with
  `setRGB(..., THREE.SRGBColorSpace)` or the whole fly washes out.
- `import.meta.url` is undefined in esbuild's CommonJS output, so anything
  resolving paths from it must also handle `__dirname`.
- Main must not *push* startup data to the renderer on `did-finish-load`: the
  renderer subscribes after that fires. Use `invoke`/`handle`.
- A GUI Electron process on Windows has no usable stdout — renderer errors go to
  `windows/renderer.log`, and `capturePage()` on a *visible* window needs an
  interactive desktop surface (use a hidden window to capture headlessly).
- `backgroundThrottling: false` is load-bearing: the sim clock runs off
  `requestAnimationFrame`, which Chromium throttles to ~1 Hz when occluded.
- **Native modules must be `external` in esbuild**, never bundled — `koffi`
  included. Bundling it rewrote its own `createRequire(import.meta.url)` and hung
  the app at load.
- koffi's `.d.ts` omits `proto`/`register`/`unregister`/`address` though all exist
  at runtime, and `register()` needs `pointer(proto)`, not the bare proto.
  `LASTINPUTINFO` must be declared `_Inout_` or `dwTime` comes back 0.
- `GetTickCount()` and `LASTINPUTINFO.dwTime` are **unsigned 32-bit** ms counters
  that wrap every ~49.7 days. Subtract them with `core/idle.ts`'s `tickDelta`,
  never with `-`: plain subtraction goes negative across a wrap, which clamped
  idle to 0 (so a machine idle across the wrap never slept) and made the first
  input after a wrap look like no input at all.
- Window ids must be **HWNDs, carried as strings**: with array indices every poll
  reports every window as newly appeared, and `Number(koffi.address(hwnd))` would
  lose precision above 2^53-1 (real HWNDs are 32-bit significant, so that is
  latent, not live). Ids are equality-only, so `handleId()` keeps them exact.
- Both windows must share one always-on-top band, or the full-screen overlay pins
  the brain window beneath it. This machine has 31 topmost windows, so ordering
  inside the band drifts; always-on-top is re-asserted on the window poll because
  Windows silently strips it for full-screen apps.
- Pause must reset the sim clock, not lean on the dt clamp: 50 ms of catch-up is
  still a visible jump.
- Packaging: `electron` must sit in devDependencies (electron-builder supplies the
  runtime), `koffi` must be `asarUnpack`ed (a `.node` cannot load from an asar),
  and `findDataDir` probes `process.resourcesPath` because a packaged app has no
  repo above it.

**Windows port architecture** (differs from macOS in two deliberate ways):
- **The sim lives in the overlay renderer**, not main. Spikes travel overlay →
  main → brain window and stimulation travels back, so only visuals cross IPC —
  the LC→GF escape race, where 4 ms decides the outcome, never does. Do not move
  the sim to main "for tidiness".
- **The overlay spans every display**, where macOS keeps one screen and hops on
  command. The window is the bounding box; `core/arena.ts` confines the fly to the
  union of the real monitor rectangles, because offset monitors of different sizes
  leave parts of that box on no display. Point sizing in the brain window must be
  **screen-space** (`sizeAttenuation: false`), matching SceneKit's
  min/maxPointScreenSpaceRadius, or the 23k-point cloud reads as dim dust.

**Caveat on the walk-duty invariant**: "walk-drive duty 20–50%" is a typical
run, not a bound. The 330 partner neurons draw random baselines that set the
drive onto DNp09, so duty spans ~17–43% across RNG seeds (measured in the
Windows port, which can pin the seed; the Swift build reshuffles it every run).
Treat a single low reading as normal variance, not a regression.

**SourceKit note**: the IDE reports "Cannot find type ..." across files —
false positives. The five .swift files compile as one module via build.sh;
trust the compiler, not single-file diagnostics.

## Threading model

- SceneKit render thread: `Coordinator.renderer(_:updateAtTime:)` steps the
  sim and updates flies. All cross-thread mutation goes through
  `Coordinator.enqueue {}` (lock + pending-actions queue, drained per frame).
- Main thread: timers (mouse 30 Hz, windows 0.7 s), menu actions, global
  click monitor — these only call enqueue/setters.
- Brain window has its own render delegate; spikes cross via `SpikeBus` (locked).
- `LIFSim.stimulate()` is thread-safe (pending list merged at `step()`).

## Frame contract (`Coordinator.renderer`, main.swift:632)

The one place the body↔brain loop closes; read it top-to-bottom before changing
any sense or signal.

1. **senses → sim inputs** — `loomL/loomR` = max(cursor loom, exponentially
   decaying window loom); `airPuff` = max(cursor whoosh, `typingLevel × 0.30`);
   `gaitDrive`/`gaitPhase` = fly #1's `walkingIntensity`/`gaitPhasePublic`
   (body→brain proprioception, injected onto ascending neurons with per-neuron
   phase offsets); `activityScale` = `(1 − (1−activity)×0.35) × (sleepy ? 0.75 : 1)`;
   `sensoryGate` = 0.55 asleep. `computeLoom` (radial approach ÷ distance,
   split between eyes by bearing sign) is the last non-connectome step —
   everything downstream of LC4/LPLC2 is real wiring.
2. **fixed 1 kHz stepping** — `msAccumulator` turns frame dt into whole
   milliseconds, clamped to 50 per frame, so the sim never chases a stalled
   render thread. `sim.simMs` therefore drifts behind wall time after a hitch.
3. **rates → commands** — `SignalBuilder.make`, shared verbatim with
   `--behaviortest` (that's what makes the suite meaningful).
4. **commands → body** — `fly.update(...)`: fly #1 gets `signals`, the rest `nil`.

`SignalBuilder` normalizations — change a divisor and every threshold in
`brainBehavior` shifts with it:

| signal | formula | clamp |
|---|---|---|
| `escape` | `consumeGF()` — latch, drained once per frame | bool |
| `nervous` | `rateLoom / 80` | 0…1 |
| `turnBias` | `(rateDNaL − rateDNaR − 8 s EMA baseline) × 0.04` | ±1 |
| `walkDrive` | `rateFwd / 10` | 0…1.3 |
| `groomDrive` | `rateGroom / 8` | **none** — add one if you touch it |
| `wingDrive` | `rateEscW / 10` | 0…1.3 |
| `arousal` | `ratePop / 20` | 0…1 |
| `backward` | `rateMDN > 8` | bool |

`tempo` and `sleep` are set by the coordinator afterwards, not by the sim.

## Body state machine (`FlyModel.swift`)

`State = walking | idle | grooming | flying | sleeping`. `Fly.update` routes
three ways: `flying` → `updateFlight` only, so brain signals reach the **wings**
(`brainLive`/`liveArousal`/`liveWing` → `effortCurrent`) but never the
trajectory — flight is ballistic from `startFlight` to the flare; grounded with
signals → `brainBehavior`; grounded without signals → the legacy
mouse-distance path (`SCARE_RADIUS`/`NERVOUS_RADIUS`, extra flies only).

Inside `brainBehavior` the order is load-bearing: `escape` is tested first and
interrupts even sleep; `sleep` then returns early, so nothing else can fire
while asleep (waking always routes through `.grooming`). Ledge attachment lives
in `updateWalk`, and `heading += turnBias·dt` is suppressed while on a ledge.

## Neuron → behavior mapping (current)

| role slug | FlyWire types (count) | drives | consumed in |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lc4`, `lplc2` | LC4 (104), LPLC2 (210) | looming input → nervous darting; excite GF | `BrainSignals.nervous` |
| `gf` | DNp01 (2) | escape takeoff (spike = takeoff) | `BrainSignals.escape` |
| `dna01`, `dna02` | DNa01 (2), DNa02 (2) | steering: L−R rate → turn bias (slow-adapted) | `BrainSignals.turnBias` |
| `dnp09` | DNp09 (2) | walk/rest hysteresis + walking speed | `BrainSignals.walkDrive` |
| `dng11` | DNg11 (6) | grooming hysteresis | `BrainSignals.groomDrive` |
| `mdn` | MDN (4) | backward walking burst | `BrainSignals.backward` |
| `escw` | DNp02/DNp04/DNp11 (6) | wing-beat effort in flight, threat wing-raise | `BrainSignals.wingDrive` |
| `other`+ascending (27) | strongest ascending partners | body→brain gait proprioception (input target) | `sim.gaitDrive/gaitPhase` |
| `other`+sensory (16) | strongest sensory partners | wind/tap input; electrically boosted onto GF | `sim.airPuff`, taps |

Whole-population rate → `BrainSignals.arousal` (spontaneous-takeoff gate,
flight effort). Only fly #1 has the brain; extra flies use legacy
distance-based behavior (`signals: nil` path).

## Adding a new neuron population (recipe)

1. **Check the type exists** in v783:
   `gzcat consolidated_cell_types.csv.gz | grep -c ',TYPE,'` (raw dumps: see
   README "Regenerating the data" for the GCS URLs; don't commit raw dumps).
2. **etl.py**: add `"TYPE": "roleslug"` to `CORE_TYPES`; add the slug to the
   reserved-partner loop AND the in-degree report loop.
3. **Rerun ETL** and read the report: `in-circuit drive onto roleslug` should
   be ≥ several hundred synapses — if it's tiny, the population will be
   noise-driven, not network-driven (this bug shipped once for DNg11: 6 syn).
4. **Sim.swift**: group array (`private(set) var xyz: [Int]`), populate in the
   init role switch, baseline (command DNs: deterministic `0.036`; never
   random per-side for bilateral pairs — asymmetry must come from wiring),
   rate EMA (`rateXyz`) in the spike-counting switch.
5. **SignalBuilder** (main.swift): normalize `rateXyz` into a new
   `BrainSignals` field — **always clamp** (an unclamped walkDrive once sent
   the fly to 1,100 pt/s).
6. **FlyModel.brainBehavior**: consume the signal. Use hysteresis + the
   `stateAge` dwell guard (≥0.4 s) for state changes, cooldown timers for
   one-shot actions; make sure the action works from every grounded state
   (MDN was once dead from idle).
7. **BrainView.swift**: role color in the circuit overlay + `regionName` label
   (clicking that region should demo the behavior).
8. **Tests**: add a `--behaviortest` scenario (stimulate population → assert
   body reaction) and, if sim-level, a `--simtest` probe. Run both suites.

## Tuning gotchas (learned the hard way)

- **Operating point is razor-thin**: neurons rest at `baseline × 20.4` vs
  threshold 1.0 (tau 20 ms). Never scale baselines linearly by a mood/time
  factor — compress toward 1 (`1 − (1−a)×0.35`), or populations go silent
  (the "siesta coma" bug).
- **Escape is a race**: LC→GF electrical drive (×6 boost) vs ~1,200 syn of
  feedforward inhibition (4 ms delayed). Slow ramps lose to inhibition by
  design — test escapes with **abrupt** loom steps, not ramps.
- **Live modifiers must never weaken takeoff**: flight effort =
  `max(baseEffort, live formula)` (a regression once halved escape altitude).
- Weight scale 0.0008/synapse; refractory 2 ms; inhibitory synaptic delay
  4 ms (ring buffer); `weightScale`/`gapJunctionBoost` live in `Sim.swift`.
- Landing must go through the flare (alt decays below 0.035) — never snap
  scale/z in `land()`.

## Repo conventions

- Public repo: `DenisSergeevitch/desktop-fly` (master). Code MIT; `data/` is
  CC BY-NC 4.0 (FlyWire terms) — keep the license split intact.
- README numeric claims (neuron/edge/synapse counts, latencies) must match
  `data/*.json` and suite output — reviewers falsify them against the data.
  Current truth (checkable without a Mac):
  `python -c "import json;c=json.load(open('data/circuit.json'));print(len(c['neurons']),len(c['edges']))"`
  → 668 neurons, 18,968 edges (~203k synapses), 23,210 brain points.
- `.gitignore` covers the binary, logs, and root-level PNGs (diagnostics
  outputs); intentional images live in `assets/`.
- Local folder is `fly-brain`; the remote is `desktop-fly` — harmless.
